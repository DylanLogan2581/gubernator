-- Migration: fix_state_condition_notification_spam
-- Issue #879: managed_population.declining, building.suspended, and
-- settlement.starvation_occurred are state conditions that fire every turn the
-- condition persists. Previously, a notification was generated each turn the
-- condition continued, deduped only within a single transition.
--
-- Fix: add a state-entry guard to each of the three categories. Before
-- inserting a notification, check whether the immediately preceding
-- turn-transition for this world also contained a log entry with the same
-- category for the same settlement. If so, the condition was already active
-- last turn — suppress the notification. Only the first turn the condition
-- appears (state entry) produces a row.
--
-- Implementation detail: "preceding transition" is identified by
-- to_turn_number = current transition's from_turn_number. This does not rely on
-- status = 'completed' so it is safe for direct calls to the internal function
-- in tests (where the transition status is never updated).
